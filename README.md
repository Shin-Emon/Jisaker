# Jisaker
Jisaker is an application that can save time to search PC parts prices, and you can see prices of many parts.

# How to use
Jisaker is made in Java, so you should install Java 17.
Also, you build this or install jar file then.
(I developed this in Java 17)

# Attention
On Windows, Windows Defender often treats this as Virus, but this is NOT a Virus!
